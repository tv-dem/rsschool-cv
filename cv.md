   I`m 21, young juniour react developer, have experience of 6 month woking in this area.
   Generally i write code using reactJS, have experience with nextJS and TS.
   Prefer using such CSS preprocessor as SCSS or SASS modules.
   In this course i want to refresh basic js knowledge, work little more with TS and try to write something using Angular.
</p>

<p>Also i've tried other LPs, in witch i've implemented some algorithms and basic data structures</p>

<p>
    I`ve finished few times this course already, but i still learning some useful and new stuff.Because of i'm bad in self-education and need some motivation like deadlines to learn, i try tp finish rsSchool again:)
