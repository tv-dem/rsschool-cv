I`m 21, motivated junior reactJS developer, have experience of 6 months working in this area.
Generally I write code using reactJS, have experience with nextJS and TS.
Prefer using such CSS preprocessor as SCSS or SASS modules.
In this course I want to refresh basic js knowledge, work little more with TS and try to write applications using Angular.

However, I've tried other LPs in wich I've implemented some algorithms and basic data structures.

I`ve already finished few times this course, but i still learn useful and new stuff. Because i'm bad in self-education and need motivation like deadlines to learn, I try to finish rsSchool again.
